# Coverage Analysis Tools

This directory contains tools used for processing coverage outputs and matching
them against an audit list generated by Smatch.

## fast\_matcher

Convert IP traces to detailed line coverage and optionally match this against a smatch report.

## smatcher

Consume line coverage from multiple fuzzing campaigns and match them against a smatch report.
This tool prints useful statistics, such as the coverage of different item
classifications and how well certain target functions have been covered.

## stimulus\_minimizer

Process kernel trace and gcov outputs of a candidate userspace stimulus
execution and compare against smatch audit list. This can be used to filter
stimulus programs with relevant Smatch coverage and stack traces from a large
amount of candidate stimulus payloads.

Used to find interesting orthogonal stimulus payloads from a Syzkaller corpus.
